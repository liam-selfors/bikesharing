## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. A presentation was made with visualizations that show:
* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### High-level summary of the results
